# Taunt Jekyll Theme

Demo: [taunt-jekyll.netlify.com](https://taunt-jekyll.netlify.com)

## Simple guide

- Updates to site title, description etc. --> `_config.yml`
- Updates to the main navigation --> `navigation.html`
- Updates to the footer --> `footer.html`
- Updates to about page --> `about.md`

Everything else should be fairly straightforward since it is a very basic theme.

### Sidenote

The theme ships with one included example blog post from my personal website (which is *not* open source) and can be found here: [https://bradleytaunt.com/2016/05/28/aqua-ui-buttons/](https://bradleytaunt.com/2016/05/28/aqua-ui-buttons/)

Everything else about this theme is open source :)
