<p class="lead">I'm Bradley Taunt, a designer/developer hybrid, and this the Jekyll theme used on <a href="https://taunt-jekyll.netlify.com">taunt-jekyll.netlify.com</a>.</p>

I work as the Senior Product Designer at Benbria in Ottawa. My passion lies in building reusable and maintainable CSS, with a focus on accessibility and web performance. Articles written on this site are a reflection of that passion.
