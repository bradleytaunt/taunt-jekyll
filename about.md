<p class="lead">I'm Bradley Taunt, a designer/developer hybrid, and this is my personal jekyll theme used on <a href="https://bradleytaunt.com">bradleytaunt.com</a>.</p>

I work as the Senior Product Designer at Benbria in Ottawa. My passion lies in building reusable and maintainable CSS, with a focus on accessibility and web performance. Articles written on this site are a reflection of that passion.

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bradtaunt). Interested in some of my open source projects? Check out my [repos](https://github.com/bradleytaunt).
